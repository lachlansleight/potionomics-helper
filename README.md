# Potionomics Helper

The ingredient browser in-game in Potionomics is terrible. I completed my first playthrough with the aid of a very complex Excel spreadsheet - this site is a better, faster, prettier and easier-to-use web-app version of that spreadsheet.

I've decided I need to stop playing so much Potionomics and get some actual work done, but if I come back to the game I'll probably add the ability to create potions in this app, since it's faster than having to create them in-game to find good combinations.

Because this might help somebody, the thresholds for various potion stabilities are (as maximum percentage offsets from the 'ideal' magimin ratios described in the in-game recipe book - these values are accurate to within 0.01%):

  * Perfect: < 0.25%
  * Very Stable: 0.25% - 5.25%
  * Stable: 5.25% - 15.25%
  * Unstable: 15.25% - 25.25%
  * Not Craftable: > 25.25%
